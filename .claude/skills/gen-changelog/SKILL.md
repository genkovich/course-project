  subjects into plain language under the six Keep a Changelog categories (Added/Changed/Deprecated/
  Removed/Fixed/Security). The result must have FEWER lines than the raw log — that is the proof of
  curation, not a dump. Leaves the edit in the working tree; never commits or pushes.

# Skill: gen-changelog

Goal: turn the raw commit log since the last release into the curated `## [Unreleased]` section of `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — a list a non-engineer reads once and understands.

This is the manual half of the changelog step. The same curation discipline runs headless inside gate 1 (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) when a feature PR merges; the logic is identical, only where it runs changes.

## Inputs

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — its existing style and the latest released version.
- The commits since that release (`git log <tag>..HEAD`).
- `templates/changelog-entry.md` — the shape of a curated `[Unreleased]` block.

## Protocol

1. **Find the baseline.** Read `docs/CHANGELOG.md`. The latest released version is the highest `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading — ignore `## [Unreleased]`, which you are about to fill.
2. **Read the raw input.** Run `git log <latest-tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges` (the tag matches the version, e.g. `v0.1.0`).
3. **Curate — three moves, this is the whole point:**
   - **Filter out** what a reader never feels: `test:`, `ci:`, tooling-only `chore:`, merge commits.
   - **Group** several commits about one feature into a single bullet.
   - **Rewrite** the technical subject into plain language. Drop the `feat:` / `fix:` prefix.
4. **Place each bullet** under one of the six Keep a Changelog categories — **Added · Changed · Deprecated · Removed · Fixed · Security** — and write them into `## [Unreleased]`. Skip any empty category. Follow `templates/changelog-entry.md`.
5. **Keep the `## [Unreleased]` heading on top** so the next cycle repeats.

## Definition of Done

- `## [Unreleased]` holds curated bullets under the right Keep a Changelog categories.
- The result has **fewer lines than the raw `git log`** — noise filtered, one-feature commits grouped.
- Each bullet is one line, plain language, no `feat:`/`fix:` prefix, no trailing period.
- The edit is in the working tree only — not committed, not pushed.

## Anti-patterns

- **Transcribing, not curating.** If the changelog has as many lines as the log, you dumped it. Filter and group.
- **Leaving in the noise.** `test:`, `ci:`, tooling `chore:`, and merge commits never reach a user-facing changelog.
- **Technical phrasing.** "add idx on memes.tags" is a commit subject, not a changelog line. Write "faster lookup of memes by tag".
- **Committing or pushing.** Leave the suggestion in the working tree; a human applies it.
- **Editing outside `docs/`.**
